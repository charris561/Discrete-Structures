Persons wishing to communicate securely with the owner of a key pair will encrypt messages using the public key, and only the owner can decrypt those messages with the private key. Another use case is digital signatures, where the owner will encrypt metadata about the message using the private key. Anyone with the public key can decrypt such a signature that only the private key could have created.\n",

So, for example, $42\\,mod\\,17 = 8$, because $2\\times 17 + 8 = 42$.\n",

The \"owner\" of this set of such integers can <mark>share $e$ and $n$</mark> so that others can encrypt messages that only she can read. Traditionally, such a person is refered to as Alice, and the person to whom she shares this \"public\" information is called Bob.\n",

For each <mark>$m\\in M$ he calculates $c = m^e\\,mod\\,n$ and assembles $C = [c_0,\\cdots c_n]$ and sends $C$ to Alice</mark>. Alice then uses <u>$d$</u>, which she has kept to herself in all the world, to calculate from each <mark>$c\\in C$, $m = c^d\\,mod\\,n$. She then assembles $M=[m_0\\cdots m_n]$ and reversing the previously agreed conversion from message to numbers, retrieves the secret message.</mark>\n",

So, if we let <b><u>$a=k$ and $b=e$, then $gcd(a,b) = gcd(k,e) = 1$ since $e$ is prime</b></u>. And we have an equation that might look eerily familiar: <b><u>$db-va=1$</b></u>.\n",

With production ready systems, which employ *very* large values for $p$ and $q$, this becomes computationally very expensive. Look forward to CS4720 to appreciate what that really means.

Since we know that $p$ and $q$ selected for RSA are prime, we know that only $p$ and $q$ will evenly divide $n$, so we just need to find that first $p$.\n",
